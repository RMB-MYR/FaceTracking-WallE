Project Description:

As part of the academic programme, a compact project was developed: a 3D-printed Wall-E robot equipped with an integrated camera and facial recognition system.

The Wall-E is capable of tracking passers-by using its camera. When a face is detected, its eyes light up red, and its head dynamically follows the identified person. This project combines robotics, 3D printing, and image processing to create an interactive and engaging application.
